Installation Instructions
*************************

Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package. Howevere, the build scripts
depends on gnuweb project available at https://github.com/mobilana/gnuweb  

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  6. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
     files again.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' installs the package's content under
`/usr/local/lib/php'.  You can specify an installation prefix other 
than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for PHP files.  If you
pass the argument `libphpdir=DIR' to `configure'.

Multiple Configuration
======================

   If you want to maintain a various configurations for development,
staging and production environments then you can use VPATH feature.
You can create a build folder dedicated for configuration and run `configure'
script from it, e.g.

   1. mkdir plat-stage
   2. cd plat-stage
   3. ../configure --prefix=/path/to/stage 
   4. make && make install
